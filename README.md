[Casper.thy](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nano-o/pos/master/browser_info/Casper.html) (source [`Casper.thy`]([./Casper.thy])) is an experiment in which I shortened Yoichi Hirai's original proof [MinimumAlgo.thy](./MinimumAlgo.thy) from about 1000 lines to less than a 100 by encoding things in FOL and in particular EPR as much as possible. See also the [PDF version of the proof](./output/document.pdf).


It seems that this proof was later re-used by Yoichi Hirai in [CasperOneMessage.thy](./CasperOneMessage.thy) and then translated to Coq by Runtime Verification (see [https://github.com/runtimeverification/casper-proofs/blob/master/Core/AccountableSafety.v](https://github.com/runtimeverification/casper-proofs/blob/master/Core/AccountableSafety.v)).
