Casper.thy is an experiment in which I shortened Yoichi Hirai's original proof (MinimumAlgo.thy) from about 1000 lines to less than a 100 by encoding things in FOL and in particular EPR as much as possible.

It seems that this proof was later re-used by Yoichi Hirai in (CasperOneMessage.thy) and then translated to Coq by Runtime Verification (\url{https://github.com/runtimeverification/casper-proofs/blob/master/Core/AccountableSafety.v}), although the attribution to me was lost in the process.

The pdf version of the proof is in output/document.pdf
