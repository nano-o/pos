\tableofcontents

This is an experiment dating from 2017 in which I shortened an Isabelle/HOL proof by Yoichi Hirai from about 1000 lines to less than 100 by encoding things in EPR as much as possible.

It seems that this proof was later re-used by Yoichi Hirai and then translated to Coq by Runtime Verification: \url{https://github.com/runtimeverification/casper-proofs/blob/master/Core/AccountableSafety.v}, although the attribution to me was lost in the process.
